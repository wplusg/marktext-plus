- [MarkText](https://github.com/marktext/marktext) is a free and open source markdown editor originally written by [Jocs](https://github.com/Jocs) and [contributors](https://github.com/marktext/marktext/graphs/contributors).

- Sadly, the core repository became unmaintained since about 3 years ago, but various Quality of Life issues remained that I noticed in my daily usage.

- This repository serves as an attempt at modernising my favourite Markdown Editor, and is a fork based off [Jacob Whall's Fork](https://github.com/jacobwhall/marktext)
  - See [my motivation below](#1-soo-is-this-fork-any-different-from-the-countless-others)

# 5. Motivation

## 1. Soo is this fork any different from the countless others?

- A main gripe I had when looking into `marktext` was that the development framework + environment was aging badly and took forever to compile
  - Most libaries were outdated and some couldn't even be installed with modern versions of Node.JS/Python

- Hence, this fork is kind of a major "re-write" that makes use of [electron-vite](https://electron-vite.org/) instead of the old `Babel + Webpack` setup
  - The goal here is to give `marktext` a **fresh start** using **modern frameworks and libraries as much as possible**
  - Everything has also been migrated to `Vue3` and `Pinia` with all libraries updated to their latest possible versions

- The `main` and `preload` processes are still compiled to `CommonJS`, but the `renderer` is now fully **`ESModules` only** (_which posed some interesting issues during migration_)

## 2. That's cool! How can I help?

- Any form of:
  1. Testing for bugs (Bug-Reports)
  2. Pull Requests

  Are more than welcome!

- You can find a basic list of commands for getting around this repo below, but otherwise - the file structure should be **very similar to the original marktext**

## 3. Project Setup

- See [Developer Documentation](docs/dev/README.md)
